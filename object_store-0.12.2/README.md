# Rust Object Store

A focused, easy to use, idiomatic, high performance, `async` object
store library for interacting with object stores.

Using this crate, the same binary and code can easily run in multiple
clouds and local test environments, via a simple runtime configuration
change. Supported object stores include:

* [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
* [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/)
* [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage)
* Local files
* Memory
* [HTTP/WebDAV Storage](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2518)
* Custom implementations

Originally developed by [InfluxData](https://www.influxdata.com/) and later donated to [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/).

See [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/object_store) for usage instructions

## Support for `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target

It's possible to build `object_store` for the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target, however the cloud storage features `aws`, `azure`, `gcp`, and `http` are not supported.

```
cargo build -p object_store --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```
