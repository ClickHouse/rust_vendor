/// A hierarchical sequence identifier that exists within a shared universe.

/// of indices (e.g., `[0, 1, 2]`). The API design prevents collisions by only allowing
/// new IDs to be created through controlled advancement or descent operations.
///
/// # Hierarchy and Ordering
///
/// IDs are hierarchical and lexicographically ordered:
/// - `[0]` < `[0, 0]` < `[0, 1]` < `[1]` < `[1, 0]`
/// - A parent ID like `[0, 1]` can spawn children `[0, 1, 0]`, `[0, 1, 1]`, etc.
/// - Sibling IDs are created by advancing: `[0, 0]` → `[0, 1]` → `[0, 2]`
///
/// # Drop Ordering
///
/// When a SequenceId is dropped, it may wake futures waiting for ordering guarantees.
/// The `collapse()` method leverages this to provide deterministic ordering of
/// recursively created sequence IDs.
