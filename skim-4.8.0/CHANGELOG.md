## [4.0.0] - 2026-03-10

### Changes

`sk` is now beating `fzf` in interactive matching for time, peak memory usage and CPU usage ! See the benchmarks below for details, including a brief explanation of the benchmark itself.

This release brings multiple breaking changes, please read the following if you have doubts about the update.

#### Default to the Arinae matcher

The biggest change of them all is that the default algorithm is now `Arinae`, skim's latest and most performant algorithm, featuring typo-resistance. If you want to keep using `SkimV2`, pass `--algo skim_v2` and please take the time to open an issue explaining why if possible.
This also makes the `--scheme` option available to the default matcher, allowing for more refined matching scenarii.

#### Default to non-typo resistant

Typo-resistant behavior is now disable by default, add `--typos` to your skim invocation or `SKIM_DEFAULT_OPTIONS` to get it back. Unless you were using the `frizbee`, `fzy` or `arinae` matcher, this should not impact you.

#### Removal of the `skim_v1` algorithm

The `SkimV1` algorithm, skim's initial algorithm, has been deprecated for years now, and it has now been removed.

#### SkimItem index (library only)

`SkimItem::get_index` and `SkimItem::set_index` are gone, and all index handling is now done internally.

### Benchmarks

This benchmarks runs the interactive interface in a tmux session, and waits for the UI to stabilize.
It uses a 10 million path-like ASCII items input file, and the query `test`.

### 🚀 Features

- [**breaking**] Internally compute indexes at match time (removes get/set_index) (#1001)
- [**breaking**] Use Arinae as default algorithm

### ⚙️ Miscellaneous Tasks

- [**breaking**] Default to disabled typos
- Use python for bench script for comparison

## [3.7.0] - 2026-03-08

This adds a new library API: `Skim::run_items`. Using this, you don't need to send the items, the library handles it for you.

Instead of writing this:

```rust
use skim::prelude::*;
let (rx, tx) = unbounded();

// We need MySkimItem to override the set_index/get_index methods
struct MySkimItem {
    value: String,
    index: usize
}

impl SkimItem for MySkimItem {
    // Implement the default members
}

tx.send(MySkimItem { value: String::from("foo"), index: 0 });
tx.send(MySkimItem { value: String::from("bar"), index: 1 });

let res = Skim::run_with(options, Some(rx));
```

You can simply write this:
```rust
use skim::prelude::*;

let res = Skim::run_with(options, ["foo", "bar"]);
```

It will automatically convert any iterator of <impl SkimItem> by adding an `index` field and then send it, before running skim.

### 🚀 Features

- Add `scheme` for better filepath matching in Arinae

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

## [3.6.1] - 2026-03-03

### ⚙️ Miscellaneous Tasks

- Switch allocator to mimalloc for ~20% perf in some cases
- Add bench plot scripts

## [3.6.0] - 2026-03-02

This version adds the Arinae algorithm as an option.

Arinae is designed to become skim's default algorithm in the future.

Technically, it uses Smith-Waterman and a modified Levenshtein distance with affine gaps for scoring, as well as multiple optimizations (the main ones being a loose prefilter and checks for early dismissal of paths that cannot lead to the best match). It also forbids typos on the first char of the query.

In practice, it should feel close to FZY's scoring with typos disabled, but with a more natural behavior regarding typos as Frizbee or other algorithms.

These other algorithms usually work by allowing a set number of typos using 3D matrices for computations, the max-typos value being set based on the length of the query. In practice, that meant that tes will match exactly, but test will allow one typo, meaning that typing a single character will change the filtered items completely. This algorithm will instead penalize typos, not block them completely.

This algorithm does not aim to revolution anything, but it aims at making typo-resistant fuzzy matching feel more like an actual alternative to the current options (namely FZF and FZY), while maintaining per-item performance at least as good as the current algorithms.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-02-12

### Changes

#### For everyone

Memory usage was optimized, bringing a ~25% reduction in memory usage in our benches. Thanks to @kimono-koans for the initial idea and help with this.

#### For CLI users

- Added a `:pty` preview-window flag that will make the preview run in a PTY. This allows for more interactive commands and more complicated display, including running `sk` itself inside `sk`'s preview (run `SKIM_DEFAULT_OPTIONS='--preview "sk" --preview-window ":pty"' sk` for the extreme version).
    Note: the `pty` preview does not take input (for now). For instance, scrolling in paged output will not work.
- Readded `--sync` functionality after it was broken in v1

#### For library users

- A more fine-grained control over skim's event loop is now possible using `tokio` and the new methods on `Skim`. Check them out if you want to interact with the skim instance while it is running.
- [**breaking**] The `SkimOptionsBuilder`'s setter methods are back to taking raw `&str`s instead of `String`s. This should match the behavior pre-v1, sorry for the extra work that some of you already put in to migrate.

### 🚀 Features

- Interactive pty preview & concurrency optimizations (#952)
- Optimize match_item to use ref and not Arc (#962)
- Reduce DefaultSkimItem memory footprint by around 25% by default (#966)
- [**breaking**] Use smarter setters, remove the need for Some(...) and String::from() in setters
- Readd `--sync` functionality
- *(lib)* Add fine-grained control over skim's event loop (#968)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
