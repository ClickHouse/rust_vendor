/// sk - fuzzy finder in Rust
///
/// sk is a general purpose command-line fuzzy finder.
///
///
/// # ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
///
/// ## SKIM_DEFAULT_COMMAND
///
/// Default command to use when input is tty. On *nix systems, sk runs the command with sh -c, so make  sure  that
/// it's POSIX-compliant.
///
/// ## SKIM_DEFAULT_OPTIONS
///
/// Default options. e.g. `export SKIM_DEFAULT_OPTIONS="--multi"`
///
/// # EXTENDED SEARCH MODE
///
/// Unless specified otherwise, sk will start in "extended-search mode". In this mode, you can specify multiple  patterns
/// delimited by spaces, such as: 'wild ^music .mp3$ sbtrkt !rmx
///
/// You can prepend a backslash to a space (\ ) to match a literal space character.
///
/// ## Exact-match (quoted)
///
/// A term that is prefixed by a single-quote character (') is interpreted as an "exact-match" (or "non-fuzzy") term. sk
/// will search for the exact occurrences of the string.
///
/// ## Anchored-match
///
/// A term can be prefixed by ^, or suffixed by $ to become an anchored-match term. Then sk will  search  for  the  lines
/// that start with or end with the given string. An anchored-match term is also an exact-match term.
///
/// ## Negation
///
/// If  a  term  is prefixed by !, sk will exclude the lines that satisfy the term from the result. In this case, `sk` per‚Äê
/// forms exact match by default.
///
/// ## Exact-match by default
///
/// If you don't prefer fuzzy matching and do not wish to "quote" (prefixing with ') every word,
/// start `sk` with `-e` or
/// `--exact` option. Note that when `--exact` is set, '-prefix "unquotes" the term.
///
/// ## OR operator
///
///  A  single bar character term acts as an OR operator. For example, the following query matches entries that start with
/// core and end with either go, rb, or py.
///
///
/// **Example**: `^core go$ | rb$ | py$`
///
///
/// # EXIT STATUS
///
/// * 0:      Normal exit
///
/// * 1:      No match
///
/// * 2:      Error
///
/// * 130:    Interrupted with CTRL-C or ESC
