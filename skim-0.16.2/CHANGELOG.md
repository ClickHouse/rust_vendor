  collections.

## 0.6.0: 2019-03-17

Performance improvement.

This is a large rewrite of skim, previously there are 4 major components of
skim:

- reader: for reading from command or piped input
- sender: will cache the lines from reader and re-send all lines to matcher on restart
- matcher: match against the lines and send the matched items to model
- model: handle the selection of items and draw on screen.

They are communicated using rust's `channel` which turned out to be too slow
in skim's use case. Now we use `SpinLock` for sharing data. The performance on
large collections are greatly improved.

Besides, use `tuikit` for buferred rendering.

## 0.5.5: 2019-02-23

Bug fixes:

- fix: regression on `--with-nth` feature
- fix: 100% CPU on not enough printing area

## 0.5.4: 2019-02-20

Emergency release that fix test failures which breaks
[APKBUILD](https://github.com/5paceToast/user-aports/blob/master/toast/skim/APKBUILD).
Check out [#128](https://github.com/lotabout/skim/issues/128).

## 0.5.3: 2019-02-20

Features:

- `--header` for adding header line
- `--inline-info` for displaying info besides query
- run preview commands asynchronizely
- implement action `delete-charEOF`
- support key: `ctrl+space`

More bug fixes, noticable ones are:

- Panic on reading non-utf8 characters
- 100% CPU when input is not ready

## 0.5.2: 2018-10-22

- fix: stop command immediately on accept or abort.
- minor optimization over ASCII inputs.
- [#90](https://github.com/skim-rs/skim/issues/90): escape quotes in specified preview command

## 0.5.1: 2018-06-24

Use [cross](https://github.com/japaric/cross) to build targets.

## 0.5.0: 2018-06-12

Change the field syntax to be fzf compatible.

- Previously it was git style
  - fields starts with `0`
  - `1..3` results in `2, 3` (which is `0, 1, 2, 3` minus `0, 1`)
- Now it is `cut` style
  - fields starts with `1`
  - `1..3` results in `1, 2, 3`

## 0.4.0: 2018-06-03

Refactor skim into a library. With minor bug fixes:

- support multiple arguments, to be a drop-in replacement of fzf.
- support negative range field. (e.g. `-1` to specify the last field)
- respond to terminal resize event on Mac.

## 0.3.2: 2018-01-18

Some minor enhancements that might comes handy.

- Reserve all fzf options, so that skim can be a drop-in replacement of fzf.
- Fix: the number of columns a unicode character occupies
- Accept multiple values for most options. So that you can safely put them
  in `$SKIM_DEFAULT_OPTIONS` and override it in command line.

Thanks to [@magnetophon](https://github.com/magnetophon) for the bug report and feature requests.

## 0.3.1: 2017-12-04

Support more options, and reserve several others. The purpose is to reuse
`fzf.vim` as much as possible.

- `--print0`: use NUL(\0) as field separator for output.
- `--read0`: read input delimited by NUL(\0) characters
- `--tabstop`: allow customizing tabstop (default to 8).
- `--no-hscroll`: disable hscroll on match.
- reserve several other options, skim will do nothing on them instead of throwing errors.

## 0.3.0: 2017-09-21

This release starts from adding `--height` featuren, ends up a big change in
the code base.

- feature: `--bind` accept character keys. Only Ctrl/Alt/F keys were accepted.
- feature: support multiple `--bind` options. (replace getopts with clap.rs)
- feature: `--tac` to reverse the order of input lines.
- feature: `--preview` to show preview of current selected line.
- feature: `--height` to use only part instead of full of the screen.
- test: use tmux for integration test
- replace [ncurses-rs](https://github.com/jeaye/ncurses-rs) with [termion](https://github.com/ticki/termion), now skim is fully rust, no C bindings.
