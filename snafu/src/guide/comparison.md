# Comparisons to similar libraries

This section of the guide contains comparisons of other popular
libraries and SNAFU, as well as lightweight migration tips to SNAFU
from those libraries.

Please note that these comparisons are *intended* to be fair, but are
written by the author of SNAFU. If there are any factual errors,
please [file an issue][issue] so it can be fixed. If you've identified
a better technique for migrating from another crate to SNAFU, please
let us know as well!
