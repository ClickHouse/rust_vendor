//! Definitions of Vortex *editions*: named, frozen sets of encodings that a writer may put in
//! a file, carrying a forever read-compatibility guarantee.
//!
//! Editions live on the session, like encodings do: [`EditionSession`] is the session
//! variable holding the edition registry, populated at initialization time. Declarations
//! are plain constants — an [`EditionId`] plus an [`Edition`] record, and one
//! [`EditionInclusion`] per encoding stating that it is a member of an edition *and every
//! later edition of the same family*. Any crate can register declarations into a session,
//! so inclusions can live next to the encoding they describe.
//!
//! An edition is a **draft** until its [`Edition::min_vortex_version`] is recorded —
//! recording it is the act of freezing. The per-edition encoding sets are computed from the
//! registered declarations by [`EditionSession::encodings_in`], and correctness is enforced
//! by unit tests: [`EditionSession::validate`] checks a whole registry, and
//! [`test_harness::validate_edition`] validates one edition's constraints — call it once in
//! the `#[cfg(test)]` module of each edition definition.
//!
//! This crate defines only the types and the session variable; the first-party edition
//! declarations live in the public `vortex` crate (`vortex::editions`), which seeds them
//! into the default session. See the published spec at
//! <https://docs.vortex.dev/specs/editions.html>.
