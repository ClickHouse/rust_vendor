//! The Vortex edition declarations.
//!
//! [`vortex_edition`] provides the types, the [`crate::editions::EditionSession`] session
//! variable, and the test harness; the actual declarations live here, one module per edition
//! (`editions::<family>::<date>`), and are seeded into the default session by
//! [`crate::editions::register_default_editions`].
//!
//! Each edition module declares the edition together with the encodings that join the
//! family at it; members of earlier editions are inherited and never restated. Correctness
//! is enforced by unit tests: every edition module calls
//! [`vortex_edition::test_harness::validate_edition`] once from its `#[cfg(test)]` module,
//! and the computed set of a frozen edition is pinned by a golden test, so any change to
//! these declarations that alters a frozen set fails CI. New encodings are staged into the
//! newest draft edition.
//!
//! Note this is currently unused but a future PR will make this public and gate the writer behind
//! editions.
