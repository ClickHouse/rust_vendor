description = "A dynamic allocator that may be used with or without the stdlib. This allows a package with nostd to allocate memory dynamically and be used either with a custom allocator, items on the stack, or by a package that wishes to simply use Box<>. It also provides options to use calloc or a mutable global variable for pre-zeroed memory"
