//! Dispatch macro used by the optimizer and executor to emit trace events.
//!
//! See [`test_harness::trace`][crate::test_harness::trace] for the harness that consumes the
//! events recorded here.

/// Dispatch a trace event from inside the optimizer or executor.
///
/// This macro is the only call-site interface for the trace harness. It is designed so that
/// release builds (and CodSpeed benchmark builds) compile every invocation away to nothing,
/// while debug-test builds with an active recorder route the call into
/// [`test_harness::trace`][crate::test_harness::trace].
///
/// # Gating
///
/// Each invocation expands to a `cfg`-gated branch:
///
/// - When `test` OR `_test-harness` is on, AND `codspeed` is off, the body is compiled in and
///   guarded by a runtime check for an active recorder.
/// - In all other configurations, the body is replaced with `()`.
///
/// The macro is named `trace_op` because it records *operations* (optimizer rewrites, parent
/// kernels, execution steps, builder activity) rather than array values. The events it emits
/// describe what work the optimizer/executor did, not the contents of any array.
