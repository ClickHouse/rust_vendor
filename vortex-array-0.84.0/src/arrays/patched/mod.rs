//! An array that partially "patches" another array with new values.
//!
//! # Background
//!
//! This is meant to be the foundation of a fully data-parallel patching strategy, based on the
//! work published in ["G-ALP" from Hepkema et al.](https://ir.cwi.nl/pub/35205/35205.pdf)
//!
//! Patching is common when an encoding almost completely covers an array save a few exceptions.
//! In that case, rather than avoid the encoding entirely, it's preferable to
//!
//! * Replace unencodable values with fillers (zeros, frequent values, nulls, etc.)
//! * Wrap the array with a `PatchedArray` signaling that when the original array is executed,
//!   some of the decoded values must be overwritten.
//!
//! In Vortex, the FastLanes bit-packing encoding is often the terminal node in an encoding tree,
//! and FastLanes has an intrinsic chunking of 1024 elements. Thus, 1024 elements is pervasively
//! a useful unit of chunking throughout Vortex, and so we use 1024 as a chunk size here
//! as well.
//!
//! # Details
//!
//! To patch an array, we first divide it into a set of chunks of length 1024, and then within
//! each chunk, we assign each position to a lane. The number of lanes depends on the width of
//! the underlying type.
//!
//! Thus, rather than sorting patch indices and values by their global offset, they are sorted
//! primarily by their chunk, and then subsequently by their lanes.
//!
//! The Patched array layout has 4 children
//!
//! * `inner`: the inner array is the one containing encoded values, including the filler values
//!   that need to be patched over at execution time
//! * `lane_offsets`: this is an indexing buffer that allows you to see into ranges of the other
//!   two children
//! * `indices`: An array of `u16` chunk indices, indicating where within the chunk should the value
//!   be overwritten by the patch value
//! * `values`: The child array containing the patch values, which should be inserted over
//!   the values of the `inner` at the locations provided by `indices`
//!
//! `indices` and `values` are aligned and accessed together.
//!

//!
//! It turns out that this layout is optimal for executing patching on GPUs, because the
//! `lane_offsets` allows each thread in a warp to seek to its patches in constant time.
