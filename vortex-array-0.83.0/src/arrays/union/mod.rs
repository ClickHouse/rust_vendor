//! Canonical sparse union arrays.
//!
//! A [`UnionArray`] stores one `u8` type ID per row followed by one row-aligned child for each
//! variant. The type ID selects which child's value is active for a row; values in all other
//! children at that row are placeholders. Outer union nulls are stored as nulls in the type IDs
//! child, independently of nulls in the selected variant child.
//!
//! Type ID values are not validated during construction. Accessing a non-null row whose type ID
//! is not declared by the union variants will panic.
